# Hi there!

I am an M.Sc. student in theoretical chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where I study colloidal quantum dot molecules. Previously I did experimental work in the field of photocatalysis for 3D printing and solar energy harvesting.

In the summer of 2022 I will be moving to UC Berkeley to pursue a Ph.D. in chemistry.
