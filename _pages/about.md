I am Lior, a PhD candidate in chemistry at UC Berkeley.

I hold an M.Sc. in theoretical chemistry from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I studied the electronic structure of colloidal quantum dot molecules.

Previously, I worked on developing "Quantum Photoinitiators" based on semiconductor nanocrystals, as well as on studying the surface-dependent photocatalytic activity of hybrid semiconductor-metal nanocrystals.
